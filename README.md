This webpage was built to practice DOM manipulation in Javascript.

## Note

This was my second attempt to make a responsive website, it looks as intended for most screens except some laptop screens.

## Features

**Colour**: Single colour mode, you can change colour by clicking the circle which has colour. <br />
**Group**: Multi colour mode, switchs between the three colours you have chosen. <br />
**Random**: Selects a random colour each time you colour a grid. <br />
**Eraser**: Erase the mistakes you have made. <br />
**Clear**: Cleans the entire grid space allowing you to start from beginning. <br />
**Grid size**: Change the size of grid using the slider. (min=2x2, max=64x64, default=16x16). <br />
**Hover mode**: Allows you to colour the grid by just hovering the mouse above the grid or dragging your fingers across the grid in touchscreens. <br />
**Undo/Redo**: Go few steps back or ahead. <br />
